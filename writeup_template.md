**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report






---

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline is pretty straight forward in the awesome department. Used the Houghs threshold ideas. It only took minimal tweaking of the numbers on my part. I then converted to gray scale added Gaussian Blur, pretty much all like was discuss in the lessons.


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


I either I am too new of a coder or to much of an egotistical coding maniac to see any of my code  that would have any short comings. This type of code is pretty much the same over and over as a standard. Seriously this pipeline could have been writing in few styles and  the Vertices's alone could be modified fatally or as an  overall enhancement. I  am sure a more senior coder can pick this code to pieces in no time. I am happy with it though. 


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

As discussed above there are probably improvements needed. Since this is a practice demo course I did not plan on becoming to much of a perfectionist on this particular code. 

Thank you. This was fun. Please do this type of free course for the AI and Robotics, please!!!!!
